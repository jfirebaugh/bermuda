# Nothing is required by default, so you can specify `gem :bermuda` in
# your Gemfile without actually loading any step definitions (which require
# the cucumber environment established by the 'cucumber' command).

# To load the step definitions, require 'bermuda/cucumber' within a
# file in features/support/ or features/step_definitions/.
